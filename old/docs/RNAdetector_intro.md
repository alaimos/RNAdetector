# RNAdetector: a user-friendly and stand-alone pipeline for RNA-Seq data analysis
***RNAdetector*** is a user-friendly pipeline for the analysis of protein-coding genes and ncRNAs from RNA-Seq data
## Performed analyses
***RNAdetector*** allows to perform several types of analysis such as:
- Quantification and normalization
- Differential expression analysis
- miRNA-sensitive topological pathway analysis.

***RNAdetector*** supports several species such as Human, Mouse and Rat that are available for download in our remote repository.
However, It can be also easily used with any other organism by following the step-by-step procedures detailed in the user interface.
## Non-coding RNAs analyzed
In addition to mRNAs, ***RNAdetector*** can also analyze several classes of small and long ncRNAs.
##### Small non-coding RNAs
- micro RNAs (miRNAs)
- PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs)
- tRNA fragments (tRFs)
- tRNA derived small ncRNAs (tsRNAs)
##### Long non-coding RNAs
- long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
- transcribed UltraConserved Regions (tUCRs)
- circular RNAs (circRNAs)

## Features
***RNAdetector*** has several important features such as:
- Easy installation and dependencies management
- Cross-platform (Windows Professional, macOS, Ubuntu) 
- Remotely controllable
- Completely off line
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Graphical reports with the results of the analyses
