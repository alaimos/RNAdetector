### `r contrasts.to.text(curr.con)`

#### Summary

The following tables and figures report the results of the `r contrasts.to.text(curr.con)` contrast. `r curr.p.found` KEGG pathways were found significantly impacted `r curr.p.text`.
Table `r curr.tab` shows significantly impacted pathways, their accumulator and p-values as computed by MITHrIL analysis. Results are sorted from the most significant to the least significant. 

In figure `r curr.fig`, a volcano plot gives an overview of interesting pathways. The accumulation is plotted on the x-axis and the negative log10 p-value is plotted on the y-axis. A volcano plot combines the results of the statistical test with the magnitude of the pathway impact enabling quick visual identification of those genes that display large-magnitude impact that are also statistically significant. The horizontal dashed line sets the threshold for statistical significance.

In figure `r curr.fig+1`, a scatterplot gives an overview of significant pathway in terms of pathways perturbation vs over-representation (OR). Pathways are plotted using the two types of evidence computed by MITHrIL: over-representation on the x-axis (pORA) and the total pathway accumulation on the y-axis (pAcc). Each pathway is represented by a single dot. Their color represents the combined p-value. Both p-values are shown in terms of their negative log (base 10) values. The dashed lines sets the threshold for statistical significance. This divides the graph in four regions. The upper-left corner (lower-right corner) are significantly impacted pathway only for the OR analysis (perturbation analysis). The upper-right corner are significantly impacted pathway for both analysis. The lower-left corner are non-significant pathways.
